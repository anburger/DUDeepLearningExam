This project performs checks on the ResNeXt model: 
[Aggregated residual transformations for deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)

The `resnet.pytorch`-directory has been checked out from another gitlab repository (with slight custom modifications to adapt to custom use): [https://github.com/prlz77/ResNeXt.pytorch]( https://github.com/prlz77/ResNeXt.pytorch) 

============================================

Running the jupyter notebook `ResNeXt_tests_ABurger.ipynb` needs the `TestFigures/`-directory and the `resnext.pytorch`- directory `GoogleColabNotebook/ResNeXt_TrainOnFlower-102_Data_ABurger.ipynb` has been tested on google colab and runs without any local files.
